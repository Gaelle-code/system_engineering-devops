# 0x05. Processes and Signals

## Description
This project provides an introduction to Linux processes and signals, covering the basics of managing process lifecycles, monitoring running processes, and using signals to control process behavior.

## Requirements
- All scripts are written in Bash
- All files start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Second line must be a comment explaining what the script does
- All scripts must be executable

## Tasks

| Task | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `0-what-is-my-pid` | Displays the PID of the script itself |
| 1 | `1-list_your_processes` | Displays all currently running processes with hierarchy |
| 2 | `2-show_your_bash_pid` | Displays lines containing the word "bash" |
| 3 | `3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy` | Displays PID and process name of bash processes |
| 4 | `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` | Displays "To infinity and beyond" indefinitely |
| 5 | `5-dont_stop_me_now` | Stops the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using kill |
| 6 | `6-stop_me_if_you_can` | Stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond without kill/killall |
| 7 | `7-highlander` | Displays "To infinity and beyond" and handles SIGTERM |
| 7 | `67-stop_me_if_you_can` | Stops the 7-highlander process |
| 8 | `8-beheaded_process` | Kills 7-highlander using SIGKILL (signal 9) |
