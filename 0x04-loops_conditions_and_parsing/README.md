# Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

This project introduces loops, conditional statements, and basic input parsing in Bash scripting.

## Learning Objectives

- Use `for`, `while`, and `until` loops in Bash
- Implement conditional statements with `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Use `case` statements for multiple conditions
- Perform file testing operations
- Parse and manipulate data
